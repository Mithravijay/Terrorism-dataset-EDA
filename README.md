# Terrorism-dataset-EDA
Absolutely thrilled to share insights from CodersCave's Phase-I Project, focusing on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of terrorism using the Global Terrorism Database:

- Explored temporal trends, noting peak attacks in 2014 and fluctuating casualty patterns. 📅
- Identified and visualized the top 5 most active terrorist groups. 👥
- Uncovered the predominant attack type: Bombing/Explosion. 💣
- Analyzed target types, sectors, and success/failure patterns. 🎯📈
- Explored the percentage of attacks involving hostages and their outcomes. 🏴‍☠
- Visualized geographical distribution and analyzed year-wise success. 🌍

Find the dataset and project sources on LinkedIn and Kaggle. Excited for Phase-II! 🚀 #CodersCave #DataAnalysis #Terrorism #EDA #ExcitedForPhaseII
